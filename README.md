### Project Overview
This project aims to demonstrate control of an intelligent building using the Eaton EC4P-222 PLC controller. The device features 12 digital inputs, 4 analog inputs, 8 digital outputs, and 1 analog output.

### Design Objectives
The goal of this application was to implement control functionalities for a residential building with a garage, irrigated lawn, and illuminated pathway using the CODESYS environment.

### Project Components
#### Building Model
A visual simulation of the controlled structure—a single-family house with a garage, irrigated lawn, and illuminated pathways—is implemented in CODESYS.

#### Control Panel Model
A simple control panel was designed to manage various building functions through the CODESYS visualization environment.

### Controlled Functions
From the control panel, users can manage the following building functions:
- Programmable lawn irrigation
- Garage door control with driveway lighting
- Entry gate control with pathway lighting
- Programmable air conditioning
- Room and garage lighting control

### Features Implemented
- **Temperature Control**: Enables users to set and monitor indoor climate conditions.
- **Irrigation Control**: Offers semi-automatic and full-automatic modes for lawn watering based on user-defined schedules or humidity levels.
- **Lighting and Entry Control**: Allows manual and automatic control of indoor and outdoor lighting, synchronized with gate and garage door operations.

### Future Enhancements
This project serves as a foundation for expanding intelligent building automation capabilities. Future developments could include:
- Implementing user-defined operation modes (e.g., day mode, night mode, vacation mode) to optimize energy usage and enhance user convenience.

### Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates practical applications of PLC-based building automation. The implemented features illustrate the potential for scalable and user-friendly automation solutions in residential environments.
